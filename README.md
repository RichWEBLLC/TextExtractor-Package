# TextExtractor Version 1.0

## Description
TextExtractor is a Sublime Text plugin that enables quick and efficient text extraction from existing documents to new files
with automatic file numbering.

## How to Use: Using Control+m keys prompts for a base filename, and after you enter it, the plugin will automatically add the appropriate number to the end of the file and use a .txt extesnion.  All files will be places in the same path as the file that is being cut from.

To choose a new filename, use Control+Option+m and the plugin will reset the file number counter to 0001 and prompt for
a new base filename.

## Note: the super key may be different on the windows and linux versions. You'll have to try whats to the left of the space
bar on most keyboards, as I do not own a Linux or Windows system to test on.)
